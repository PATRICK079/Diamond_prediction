# 💎 Diamond Price Predictor – The 4C Model

**Diamond Price Predictor – The 4C Model!** This project leverages machine learning to estimate diamond prices using the 4Cs — **Carat, Cut, Color, and Clarity** — along with additional attributes like **depth, table**, and **dimensions**.

This project was a full pipeline experience — from raw data wrangling to real-time deployment with Streamlit.


## 🚀 What i Did

- ✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncovered trends and distributions in key diamond features.
- ✅ **Feature Engineering:** Transformed categorical and numerical data into model-ready formats.
- ✅ **Model Training & Tuning:** Built and fine-tuned multiple regression models including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Ridge & Lasso Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
- ✅ **Model Evaluation:** Assessed performance using:
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - R² Score
- ✅ **App Deployment:** Built a real-time price prediction interface using **Streamlit**.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data manipulation
- **Seaborn, Matplotlib** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Model building & evaluation
- **Streamlit** – Web app deployment
